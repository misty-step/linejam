Get ready to unleash your inner poet! We're thrilled to announce the launch of Linejam, a brand new real-time collaborative poetry game where you and your friends can create beautiful verses together. Each game consists of 9 rounds, offering plenty of opportunities for creative expression and playful collaboration. If your muse is flying solo, don't fret! You can now play against AI opponents powered by Gemini, making Linejam a fun and engaging experience whether you're a lone wolf or part of a pack.

We've also added some delightful visual flair to enhance your playing experience. Choose from four premium themes – Kenya, Mono, Vintage Paper, and Hyper – to set the mood and inspire your creativity. And when you've crafted a poem you're proud of, easily share it with the world! A simple click lets you copy your masterpiece to the clipboard, ready to paste and share wherever your heart desires.

Need a little guidance? We've included a handy floating help modal that clearly explains the game's rules. Plus, our unique word count indicator, inspired by traditional Japanese genkoyoushi paper, helps you keep track of your progress and stay within the flow.

Finally, we've made some behind-the-scenes tweaks to ensure everything runs smoothly, including fixing an issue with word counting to handle those extra spaces. Happy jamming!
