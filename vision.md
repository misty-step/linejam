# Vision

## One-Liner

A digital version of the paper folding poetry game—casual multiplayer fun with persistent, shareable artifacts.

## North Star

World-class casual party game with Stripe-level design and polish. Players should feel delighted, not overwhelmed. The game works, it's fun, it creates memorable moments with friends.

## Key Differentiators

- **Lower friction than paper**: No pens, no folding, no passing—just play
- **Persistent artifacts**: Poems live beyond the game session
- **Iterative gameplay**: Can evolve mechanics, themes, UX without physical constraints
- **Share-first design**: Digital-native sharing, not just digital capture of analog

## Target User

Friends at a gathering who want a quick, creative, funny activity. No signup required (guest mode). Works on phones. Minimal explanation needed.

## Current Focus

Polish and production-readiness:

- Stripe-level design quality inside and out
- Award-winning aesthetic (Kenya Hara minimalism + premium themes)
- Rock-solid infrastructure and architecture
- Don't overcomplicate—the core works, ship and refine

## Stretch Goal

Print-on-demand poetry booklets via Lulu API:

- Users curate favorite poems from their games
- AI-generated art + boutique design treatment
- Physical artifact shipped to them
- Small revenue cut per book

## Anti-Goals

- Heavy monetization (no subscriptions, no ads)
- Feature bloat (no gamification, leaderboards, achievements)
- Social network aspirations (not building a community platform)
